# Mastodon Toot

A simple module, that shares posts on a Mastodon instance.

It creates a remote toot, whenever a node is published (newly created, or
 published on schedule). It deletes the remote toot, whenever a node is deleted
 or unpublished.

It will not update remote toots.

This module is in an early stage of development, bigger changes are likely.
